<div class="title"><h1>Poetry</h1></div>
    <div class="box1">For the things which cant be remembered|
    You are those who appear when time and circumstance cross|
    Thus recreating that memory which was lost|
    </div>

<div class="box2"> This thing which I see is not beneath me|
    This thing is above me; This thing is all around me|
    Even in color, even in sound|
    That which I write, even contains a tiny piece of light|
    This light travels from from me and you|
    Where does it go?|
    </div>

<div class="box3">Happy is when I am me|
    When Im happy I cant see|
    Happiness or sadness its hard to see those right beside me|
    </div>

<div class="box4">Love to you is for granted|
    Love to you is a will to live|
    Love to you resurrects quickly|
    </div>

    <div class="box5">The trees talk to each other|
        As it stands, we should too|
        A burning passion fuels the heart|
        Existence fuels the soul|
        
        </div>

        <div class="box6">The moon glimmers and winks to the blind|
            Imagine your now (reality darkens)|
            Normality is not conformality|
        
            </div>

            <div class="box7">Conformality is normality|
                Normality is imaginary|
                The sun shines to the close minded|             
                </div>

                <div class="box8">Pages are from trees|
                    Memories are sowed in the heart| 
                    We forget, just as nature does|
                    Nature doesnt forget but I do|
                    Forgiveness is pain maybe|
                    At least we got to start again|
                    
                </div>
                <div class="audiocontrols">
